## System Architecture
- MemU processes inputs through a pipeline including preprocessing, summarization, embedding, classification, categorization, and persistent storage
- MemU includes a MemoryService core for managing memory operations such as store, retrieve, update, and delete
## Memory Classification
- Memories in MemU are classified into types such as profile, event, knowledge, and behavior
## Retrieval Mechanism
- MemU's retrieval pipeline includes query rewriting, context expansion, recall, re-ranking, and result assembly
