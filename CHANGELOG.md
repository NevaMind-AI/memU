## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 Highlights

This release represents a complete architectural overhaul of PersonaLab, introducing a sophisticated unified memory system with psychological analysis capabilities.

**üß† Theory of Mind Integration**
- Advanced psychological modeling
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Confidence-scored insights
- Long-term personality analysis

**üèóÔ∏è Unified Architecture**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular component design
- Extensible plugin system
- Backward compatibility

**üöÄ Performance Improvements**
- Efficient database operations
- Optimized memory usage
- Smart caching strategies
- Batch processing support

**üîß Developer Experience**
- Comprehensive documentation
- Rich example library
- Debugging tools
- Testing framework

### Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from earlier versions:

1. **API Changes**: The main Memory class now uses the unified architecture
2. **Database**: Automatic migration from old schema
3. **Configuration**: New LLM provider configuration format
4. **Dependencies**: Updated requirements (see requirements.txt)

Example migration:
```python
# Old API (still supported)
from personalab.main import Memory
memory = Memory("agent_id")

# New recommended API
from personalab.memory import MemoryManager
manager = MemoryManager()
memory = manager.get_or_create_memory("agent_id")
```

### Breaking Changes

- None in this release (full backward compatibility maintained)

### Deprecations

- Legacy Memory API will be deprecated in v0.2.0
- Old configuration format (migrate to new LLM manager)

### Known Issues

- Large conversation processing may be slow (optimization planned for v0.1.1)
- Memory search with very large datasets needs performance tuning
- Some LLM providers may have rate limiting issues

### Contributors

Special thanks to all contributors who made this release possible:
- Core architecture design and implementation
- Documentation and example creation
- Testing and quality assurance
- Code review and feedback
