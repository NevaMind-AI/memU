Use the conversation context to better understand the significance and relationships of events.\n2. Only create NEW clusters - do not recreate existing clusters listed above.\n3. You should create a Event Name for each NEW event you discover.\n4. The Event Name should be short and clear. A single word is the best (e.g., \"marriage\", \"hiking\"). Never let the name be longer than 3 words.\n5. The Event Name should contains only alphabets or space. DO NOT use any other characters including hyphen, underscore, etc.\n6. An event can be considered repeating, periodical, or routine, if they are mentioned at least twice in the memory items OR if the conversation context suggests it's a recurring theme.\n7. If an event is considered important enough (e.g., proposal), you should record it no matter how many times it is mentioned.\n8. For event content that are close (e.g., hiking and backpacking), you can merge them into a single event, and accumulate the count.\n9. Consider the conversation flow - events discussed together might indicate related themes or patterns.\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n- [Event Name]: [Memory ID of ALL memory items related to this event, separated by comma]\n- [Event Name]: [Memory ID of ALL memory items related to this event, separated by comma]\n- ...\n"
