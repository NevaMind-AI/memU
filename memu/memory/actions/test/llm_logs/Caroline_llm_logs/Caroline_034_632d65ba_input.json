Follow this structured process to analyze and store conversation information for \"Caroline\":\n\nCONVERSATION TO PROCESS:\nCAROLINE: Hey Melanie! How's it going? I wanted to tell you about my school event last week. It was awesome! I talked about my transgender journey and encouraged students to get involved in the LGBTQ community. It was great to see their reactions. It made me reflect on how far I've come since I started transitioning three years ago.\nMELANIE: Hey Caroline! Great to hear from you. Sounds like your event was amazing! I'm so proud of you for spreading awareness and getting others involved in the LGBTQ community. You've come a long way since your transition - keep on inspiring people with your strength and courage!\nCAROLINE: Thanks, Mel! Your backing really means a lot. I felt super powerful giving my talk. I shared my own journey, the struggles I had and how much I've developed since coming out. It was wonderful to see how the audience related to what I said and how it inspired them to be better allies. Conversations about gender identity and inclusion are so necessary and I'm thankful for being able to give a voice to the trans community.\nMELANIE: Wow, Caroline, you're doing an awesome job of inspiring others with your journey. It's great to be part of it and see how you're positively affecting so many. Talking about inclusivity and acceptance is crucial, and you're so brave to speak up for the trans community. Keep up the great work!\nCAROLINE: Thanks Mel! Your kind words mean a lot. Sharing our experiences isn't always easy, but I feel it's important to help promote understanding and acceptance. I've been blessed with loads of love and support throughout this journey, and I want to pass it on to others. By sharing our stories, we can build a strong, supportive community of hope.\nMELANIE: Yeah, Caroline! It takes courage to talk about our own stories. But it's in these vulnerable moments that we bond and understand each other. We all have our different paths, but if we share them, we show people that they're not alone. Our stories can be so inspiring and encouraging to others who are facing the same challenges. Thank you for using your voice to create love, acceptance, and hope. You're doing amazing!\nCAROLINE: Your words mean a lot to me. I'm grateful for the chance to share my story and give others hope. We all have unique paths, and by working together we can build a more inclusive and understanding world. I'm going to keep using my voice to make a change and lift others up. And you're part of that!\nMELANIE: Thanks, Caroline, for letting me join your journey. I'm so proud to be part of the difference you're making. Let's keep motivating and helping each other out as we journey through life. We can make a real impact together!\nCAROLINE: Yeah Mel, let's spread love and understanding! Thanks for the support and encouragement. We can tackle life's challenges together! We got this!\nMELANIE: Yes, Caroline! We can do it. Your courage is inspiring. I want to be couragous for my family- they motivate me and give me love. What motivates you?\nCAROLINE: Thanks, Mel! My friends, family and mentors are my rocks â€“ they motivate me and give me the strength to push on. Here's a pic from when we met up last week!\nMELANIE: Wow, that photo is great! How long have you had such a great support system?\nCAROLINE: Yeah, I'm really lucky to have them. They've been there through everything, I've known these friends for 4 years, since I moved from my home country. Their love and help have been so important especially after that tough breakup. I'm super thankful. Who supports you, Mel?\nMELANIE: I'm lucky to have my husband and kids; they keep me motivated.\nCAROLINE: Wow, what an amazing family pic! How long have you been married?\nMELANIE: 5 years already! Time flies- feels like just yesterday I put this dress on! Thanks, Caroline!\nCAROLINE: Congrats, Melanie! You both looked so great on your wedding day! Wishing you many happy years together!\nMELANIE: Thanks, Caroline! Appreciate your kind words. Looking forward to more happy years. Our family and moments make it all worth it.\nCAROLINE: Looks like you had a great day! How was it? You all look so happy!\nMELANIE: It so fun! We played games, ate good food, and just hung out together. Family moments make life awesome.\nCAROLINE: Sounds great, Mel! Glad you had a great time. Cherish the moments - they're the best!\nMELANIE: Absolutely, Caroline! I cherish time with family. It's when I really feel alive and happy.\nCAROLINE: I 100% agree, Mel. Hanging with loved ones is amazing and brings so much happiness. Those moments really make me thankful. Family is everything.\n\nCHARACTER: Caroline\nSESSION DATE: 2025-07-27\n\nPROCESSING WORKFLOW:\n1. STORE TO ACTIVITY: Call add_activity_memory with the COMPLETE RAW CONVERSATION TEXT as the 'content' parameter. This will automatically append to existing activity memories. DO NOT extract, modify, or summarize the conversation - pass the entire original conversation text exactly as shown above.\n\n2. THEORY OF MIND: Call run_theory_of_mind to analyze the subtle information behind the conversation and extract the theory of mind of the characters.\n\n3. GENERATE SUGGESTIONS: Call generate_memory_suggestions with the available memory items to get suggestions for what should be added to each category.\n\n4. UPDATE CATEGORIES: For each category that should be updated (based on suggestions), call update_memory_with_suggestions to update that category with the new memory items and suggestions. This will return structured modifications.\n\n5. LINK MEMORIES: For each category that was modified, call link_related_memories with link_all_items=true and write_to_memory=true to add relevant links between ALL memories in that category.\n\n6. CLUSTER MEMORIES: Call cluster_memories to cluster the memories into different categories.\n\nIMPORTANT GUIDELINES:\n- Step 1: CRITICAL: For add_activity_memory, the 'content' parameter MUST be the complete original conversation text exactly as shown above. Do NOT modify, extract, or summarize it.\n- Step 2: Use both the original conversation and the extracted activity memoryitems from step 1 for the theory of mind analysis\n- Step 3-5: Use BOTH the extracted memory items from step 1 and theory-of-mind items from step 2 for subsequent processing. You can simply concatenate the two lists of memory items and pass them to the subsequent function.\n- Step 6: IMPORTANT: Use ONLY the memory items from step 1 for clustering. DO NOT use the theory of mind results from step 2, which are inferences and are not 100% certain.\n- Each memory item should have its own memory_id and focused content\n- Follow the suggestions when updating categories\n- The update_memory_with_suggestions function will return structured format with memory_id and content\n- Always link related memories after updating categories by setting link_all_items=true and write_to_memory=true\n\nStart with step 1 and work through the process systematically. When you complete all steps, respond with \"PROCESSING_COMPLETE\"."
