Use the conversation context to better understand the background and relationships of the memory items.\n2. It is possible that a memory item is related to multiple clusters.\nExample: \"We went to hiking in Blue Ridge Mountains this summer\" is related to both \"hiking\" and \"summer events\" clusters, if both these two clusters are in the Existing Clusters.\n3. If it possible that some memory items are not related to any of the existing clusters, you don't need to force them into any cluster.\n4. DO NOT output memory items that are not related to any of the existing clusters.\n5. Consider the conversation context when determining relationships - topics discussed together might belong to the same cluster.\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n- [Memory ID]: [Cluster names that the memory item is related to, separated by comma]\n- [Memory ID]: [Cluster names that the memory item is related to, separated by comma]\n- ...\n"
