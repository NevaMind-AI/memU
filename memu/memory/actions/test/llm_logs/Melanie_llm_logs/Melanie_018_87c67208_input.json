Good to see you! How have you been?\nMELANIE: Hey Caroline! Good to see you! I'm swamped with the kids & work. What's up with you? Anything new?\nCAROLINE: I went to a LGBTQ support group yesterday and it was so powerful.\nMELANIE: Wow, that's cool, Caroline! What happened that was so awesome? Did you hear any inspiring stories?\nCAROLINE: The transgender stories were so inspiring! I was so happy and thankful for all the support.\nMELANIE: Wow, love that painting! So cool you found such a helpful group. What's it done for you?\nCAROLINE: The support group has made me feel accepted and given me courage to embrace myself.\nMELANIE: That's really cool. You've got guts. What now?\nCAROLINE: Gonna continue my edu and check out career options, which is pretty exciting!\nMELANIE: Wow, Caroline! What kinda jobs are you thinkin' of? Anything that stands out?\nCAROLINE: I'm keen on counseling or working in mental health - I'd love to support those with similar issues.\nMELANIE: You'd be a great counselor! Your empathy and understanding will really help the people you work with. By the way, take a look at this.\nCAROLINE: Thanks, Melanie! That's really sweet. Is this your own painting?\nMELANIE: Yeah, I painted that lake sunrise last year! It's special to me.\nCAROLINE: Wow, Melanie! The colors really blend nicely. Painting looks like a great outlet for expressing yourself.\nMELANIE: Thanks, Caroline! Painting's a fun way to express my feelings and get creative. It's a great way to relax after a long day.\nCAROLINE: Totally agree, Mel. Relaxing and expressing ourselves is key. Well, I'm off to go do some research.\nMELANIE: Yep, Caroline. Taking care of ourselves is vital. I'm off to go swimming with the kids. Talk to you soon!\n\nCHARACTER: Melanie\nSESSION DATE: 2025-07-25\n\nPROCESSING WORKFLOW:\n1. STORE TO ACTIVITY: Call add_activity_memory with the COMPLETE RAW CONVERSATION TEXT as the 'content' parameter. DO NOT extract, modify, or summarize the conversation - pass the entire original conversation text exactly as shown above.\n\n2. GET CATEGORIES: Call get_available_categories to see what memory categories are available.\n\n3. GENERATE SUGGESTIONS: Call generate_memory_suggestions with the extracted memory items to get suggestions for what should be added to each category.\n\n4. UPDATE CATEGORIES: For each category that should be updated (based on suggestions), call update_memory_with_suggestions to update that category with the new memory items and suggestions. This will return structured modifications.\n\n5. LINK MEMORIES: For each category that was modified, call link_related_memories with link_all_items=true and write_to_memory=true to add relevant links between ALL memories in that category.\n\n6. REFLECTION: Call run_theory_of_mind to analyze the subtle information behind the conversation and extract the theory of mind of the characters.\n\n7. GENERATE SUGGESTIONS: Call generate_memory_suggestions again to get suggestions for what in the REFLECTION result should be added to each category.\n\n8. UPDATE CATEGORIES: For each category that should be updated (based on suggestions), call update_memory_with_suggestions again to update that category with the new memory items and suggestions. This will return structured modifications.\n\nIMPORTANT GUIDELINES:\n- Step 1: CRITICAL: For add_activity_memory, the 'content' parameter MUST be the complete original conversation text exactly as shown above. Do NOT modify, extract, or summarize it.\n- Step 2-5: Use the extracted memory items from step 1 for subsequent processing\n- Step 6: Use both the original conversation and the extracted memory items from step 1 for the analysis\n- Step 7-8: Use the reflection result from step 6 for subsequent processing\n- Each memory item should have its own memory_id and focused content\n- Follow the suggestions when updating categories\n- The update_memory_with_suggestions function will return structured format with memory_id and content\n- Always link related memories after updating categories by setting link_all_items=true and write_to_memory=true\n\nStart with step 1 and work through the process systematically. When you complete all steps, respond with \"PROCESSING_COMPLETE\"."
