Caroline shared that Caroline attended a LGBTQ support group the day before, where Caroline heard inspiring transgender stories that made Caroline feel happy, thankful, accepted, and gave Caroline the courage to embrace Caroline's true self. Melanie admired Caroline's positive experience with the support group and asked about the impact it had on Caroline's life, leading Caroline to express excitement about continuing education and exploring new career options in counseling or mental health to support people with similar issues. Melanie encouraged Caroline by highlighting Caroline's empathy and understanding as qualities that would make Caroline a great counselor. Melanie showed Caroline a lake sunrise painting that Melanie painted the previous year, explaining that painting was a special and creative outlet for expressing feelings and relaxing after long days, which Caroline appreciated and related to as a meaningful form of self-expression and relaxation. Melanie mentioned that Melanie was going swimming with the kids, and Caroline said Caroline was going to do some research, both acknowledging the importance of self-care.\n\nAvailable Categories: profile, event\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Suggestions must lead to SELF-CONTAINED MEMORY ITEMS**\n\nWhen suggesting content for each category, ensure that the resulting memory items will:\n- Be complete, standalone sentences with full subjects\n- Always include \"Melanie\" instead of pronouns like \"she/he/they\"\n- Include specific names, places, dates, and full context\n- Never use \"the book\", \"the place\", \"the friend\" - always specify full titles and names\n- Be understandable without reading other memory items\n\n**CATEGORY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:**\n\nFor each category, analyze the new memory items and suggest what specific information should be extracted and added to that category:\n\n- **activity**: Detailed description of the conversation, including the time, place, and people involved\n- **profile**: ONLY basic personal information (age, location, occupation, education, family status, demographics) - EXCLUDE events, activities, things they did\n- **event**: Specific events, dates, milestones, appointments, meetings, activities with time references  \n- **Other categories**: Relevant information for each specific category\n\n**CRITICAL DISTINCTION - Profile vs Activity/Event:**\n- ✅ Profile: \"Alice lives in San Francisco\", \"Alice is 28 years old\", \"Alice works at TechFlow Solutions\"\n- ❌ Profile: \"Alice went hiking\" (this is activity), \"Alice attended workshop\" (this is event)\n- ✅ Activity/Event: \"Alice went hiking in Blue Ridge Mountains\", \"Alice attended photography workshop\"\n\n**SUGGESTION REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Specify that memory items should include \"Melanie\" as the subject\n- Mention specific names, places, titles, and dates that should be included\n- Ensure suggestions lead to complete, self-contained sentences\n- Avoid suggesting content that would result in pronouns or incomplete sentences\n- For profile: Focus ONLY on stable, factual, demographic information\n\n\nFor each category that has relevant information, provide your suggestions in the following format:\n\n**Category: [category_name]**\n- Suggestion: [What specific self-contained content should be added to this category, ensuring full subjects and complete context]\n\nOnly suggest categories where there is relevant new information to add/delete/update.
