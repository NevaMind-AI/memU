Follow this structured process to analyze and store conversation information for \"Melanie\":\n\nCONVERSATION TO PROCESS:\nMELANIE: Hey Caroline, since we last chatted, I've had a lot of things happening to me. I ran a charity race for mental health last Saturday – it was really rewarding. Really made me think about taking care of our minds.\nCAROLINE: That charity race sounds great, Mel! Making a difference & raising awareness for mental health is super rewarding - I'm really proud of you for taking part!\nMELANIE: Thanks, Caroline! The event was really thought-provoking. I'm starting to realize that self-care is really important. It's a journey for me, but when I look after myself, I'm able to better look after my family.\nCAROLINE: I totally agree, Melanie. Taking care of ourselves is so important - even if it's not always easy. Great that you're prioritizing self-care.\nMELANIE: Yeah, it's tough. So I'm carving out some me-time each day - running, reading, or playing my violin - which refreshes me and helps me stay present for my fam!\nCAROLINE: That's great, Mel! Taking time for yourself is so important. You're doing an awesome job looking after yourself and your family!\nMELANIE: Thanks, Caroline. It's still a work in progress, but I'm doing my best. My kids are so excited about summer break! We're thinking about going camping next month. Any fun plans for the summer?\nCAROLINE: Researching adoption agencies — it's been a dream to have a family and give a loving home to kids who need it.\nMELANIE: Wow, Caroline! That's awesome! Taking in kids in need - you're so kind. Your future family is gonna be so lucky to have you!\nCAROLINE: Thanks, Mel! My goal is to give kids a loving home. I'm truly grateful for all the support I've got from friends and mentors. Now the hard work starts to turn my dream into a reality. And here's one of the adoption agencies I'm looking into. It's a lot to take in, but I'm feeling hopeful and optimistic.\nMELANIE: Wow, that agency looks great! What made you pick it?\nCAROLINE: I chose them 'cause they help LGBTQ+ folks with adoption. Their inclusivity and support really spoke to me.\nMELANIE: That's great, Caroline! Loving the inclusivity and support. Anything you're excited for in the adoption process?\nCAROLINE: I'm thrilled to make a family for kids who need one. It'll be tough as a single parent, but I'm up for the challenge!\nMELANIE: You're doing something amazing! Creating a family for those kids is so lovely. You'll be an awesome mom! Good luck!\nCAROLINE: Thanks, Melanie! Your kind words really mean a lot. I'll do my best to make sure these kids have a safe and loving home.\nMELANIE: No doubts, Caroline. You have such a caring heart - they'll get all the love and stability they need! Excited for this new chapter!\n\nCHARACTER: Melanie\nSESSION DATE: 2025-07-25\n\nPROCESSING WORKFLOW:\n1. STORE TO ACTIVITY: Call add_activity_memory with the COMPLETE RAW CONVERSATION TEXT as the 'content' parameter. DO NOT extract, modify, or summarize the conversation - pass the entire original conversation text exactly as shown above.\n\n2. GET CATEGORIES: Call get_available_categories to see what memory categories are available.\n\n3. GENERATE SUGGESTIONS: Call generate_memory_suggestions with the extracted memory items to get suggestions for what should be added to each category.\n\n4. UPDATE CATEGORIES: For each category that should be updated (based on suggestions), call update_memory_with_suggestions to update that category with the new memory items and suggestions. This will return structured modifications.\n\n5. LINK MEMORIES: For each category that was modified, call link_related_memories with link_all_items=true and write_to_memory=true to add relevant links between ALL memories in that category.\n\n6. REFLECTION: Call run_theory_of_mind to analyze the subtle information behind the conversation and extract the theory of mind of the characters.\n\n7. GENERATE SUGGESTIONS: Call generate_memory_suggestions again to get suggestions for what in the REFLECTION result should be added to each category.\n\n8. UPDATE CATEGORIES: For each category that should be updated (based on suggestions), call update_memory_with_suggestions again to update that category with the new memory items and suggestions. This will return structured modifications.\n\nIMPORTANT GUIDELINES:\n- Step 1: CRITICAL: For add_activity_memory, the 'content' parameter MUST be the complete original conversation text exactly as shown above. Do NOT modify, extract, or summarize it.\n- Step 2-5: Use the extracted memory items from step 1 for subsequent processing\n- Step 6: Use both the original conversation and the extracted memory items from step 1 for the analysis\n- Step 7-8: Use the reflection result from step 6 for subsequent processing\n- Each memory item should have its own memory_id and focused content\n- Follow the suggestions when updating categories\n- The update_memory_with_suggestions function will return structured format with memory_id and content\n- Always link related memories after updating categories by setting link_all_items=true and write_to_memory=true\n\nStart with step 1 and work through the process systematically. When you complete all steps, respond with \"PROCESSING_COMPLETE\"."
