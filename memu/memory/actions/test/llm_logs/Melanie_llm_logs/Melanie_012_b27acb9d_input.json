Good to see you! How have you been?\nMELANIE: Hey Caroline! Good to see you! I'm swamped with the kids & work. What's up with you? Anything new?\nCAROLINE: I went to a LGBTQ support group yesterday and it was so powerful.\nMELANIE: Wow, that's cool, Caroline! What happened that was so awesome? Did you hear any inspiring stories?\nCAROLINE: The transgender stories were so inspiring! I was so happy and thankful for all the support.\nMELANIE: Wow, love that painting! So cool you found such a helpful group. What's it done for you?\nCAROLINE: The support group has made me feel accepted and given me courage to embrace myself.\nMELANIE: That's really cool. You've got guts. What now?\nCAROLINE: Gonna continue my edu and check out career options, which is pretty exciting!\nMELANIE: Wow, Caroline! What kinda jobs are you thinkin' of? Anything that stands out?\nCAROLINE: I'm keen on counseling or working in mental health - I'd love to support those with similar issues.\nMELANIE: You'd be a great counselor! Your empathy and understanding will really help the people you work with. By the way, take a look at this.\nCAROLINE: Thanks, Melanie! That's really sweet. Is this your own painting?\nMELANIE: Yeah, I painted that lake sunrise last year! It's special to me.\nCAROLINE: Wow, Melanie! The colors really blend nicely. Painting looks like a great outlet for expressing yourself.\nMELANIE: Thanks, Caroline! Painting's a fun way to express my feelings and get creative. It's a great way to relax after a long day.\nCAROLINE: Totally agree, Mel. Relaxing and expressing ourselves is key. Well, I'm off to go do some research.\nMELANIE: Yep, Caroline. Taking care of ourselves is vital. I'm off to go swimming with the kids. Talk to you soon!\n\n**EXISTING CLUSTERS (DO NOT recreate these):**\n\n\n**MEMORY ITEMS:**\nMemory ID: 3302b3\nContent: Melanie and Caroline had a conversation on 2025-07-26 where Caroline shared that Caroline attended a LGBTQ support group the day before, found the transgender stories inspiring, and felt happy, thankful, accepted, and gained courage to embrace Caroline's true self.\nMemory ID: 73aff4\nContent: Melanie encouraged Caroline's plans to continue education and explore career options, and Caroline expressed keen interest in counseling or working in mental health to support people with similar issues, while Melanie praised Caroline's empathy and understanding as qualities that would make Caroline a great counselor.\nMemory ID: 78e647\nContent: Melanie showed Caroline Melanie's lake sunrise painting from the previous year, and Caroline complimented the color blending and artistic expression, leading to a discussion where Melanie explained that painting serves as a fun, creative outlet to express feelings and relax after long days.\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS:**\n1. Use the conversation context to better understand the significance and relationships of events.\n2. Only create NEW clusters - do not recreate existing clusters listed above.\n3. You should create a Event Name for each NEW event you discover.\n4. The Event Name should be short and clear. A single word is the best (e.g., \"marriage\", \"hiking\"). Never let the name be longer than 3 words.\n5. An event can be considered repeating, periodical, or routine, if they are mentioned at least twice in the memory items OR if the conversation context suggests it's a recurring theme.\n6. If an event is considered important enough (e.g., proposal), you should record it no matter how many times it is mentioned.\n7. For event content that are close (e.g., hiking and backpacking), you can merge them into a single event, and accumulate the count.\n8. Consider the conversation flow - events discussed together might indicate related themes or patterns.\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n- [Event Name]: [Memory ID of ALL memory items related to this event, separated by comma]\n- [Event Name]: [Memory ID of ALL memory items related to this event, separated by comma]\n- ...\n"
