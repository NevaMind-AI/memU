Task: Extract and record significant events from the conversation session for {character_name}.

**CRITICAL: NO "NOT SPECIFIED" OR "NOT MENTIONED" CONTENT**
- NEVER create memory items saying information is "not specified", "not mentioned", "not available", or "unknown"
- ONLY extract and record information that is ACTUALLY present in the source content
